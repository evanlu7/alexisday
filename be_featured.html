            <h1>Reasons to be featured</h1>
            <p>
                The Contour of Luxury publication is structured to provide a center stage platform for 
                select brands to share the key points of their products and services that may not otherwise 
                be emphasized or featured by other outside media sources, which typically write what they 
                themselves want to publicize, not what the brand wants to specifically accentuate. 
                This is our differentiator as a blogAzine™, and the benefit to brands that are featured. 
                In essence, as a blogAzine™ we don’t write in the traditional article format, but rather 
                Alexis writes her commencing blogger expressions about a featured person or brand and provides 
                a Q&A opportunity to the individual or brand. Her Q&A is where the individual or brand is given 
                latitude to state what they would like to give prominence to. Alexis provides a certain 
                flexibility to her interviewees to work with her regarding any edits needed in her Q&A to suit 
                their brand’s agenda and that fit within the blogAzine’s™ framework objectives and standards.
